## Network Intrusion Detection System
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security mechanism designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of malicious activities or unauthorized access. Its primary purpose is to identify and respond to potential security threats in real-time.

### Overview

This project focuses on building a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using four different datasets: CICIDS 2017, CICIDS 2018, NSL KDD, and AWID. Various machine learning models and deep learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, RandomForest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), were employed for intrusion detection.
